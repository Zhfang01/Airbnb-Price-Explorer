    <p class="description">In the stacked bar plots, we can observe the distribution of room types in the Airbnb market.
        There are four main types of rooms: <span class="highlight">Shared room</span>, <span class="highlight">Hotel
            room</span>, <span class="highlight">Private room</span>, and <span class="highlight">Entire home/apt</span>. By
        analyzing the bars in the graph, we can gain insights into the popularity of each room type across different states.
        <br>
        From the graph, it is evident that the majority of Airbnb listings fall under the <span class="highlight">Entire
            home/apt</span> category, represented by the dominant mint-colored bars. <span class="highlight">This indicates that travelers prefer to
        rent an entire home or apartment for their stay</span>. There are also a considerable number of listings for <span
            class="highlight">Private rooms</span>, depicted by the green bars. However, the number of <span
            class="highlight">Shared rooms</span> and <span class="highlight">Hotel rooms</span> is relatively low in
        comparison.
        <br>
        When analyzing the cumulative plot, we can observe that <span class="highlight2">California</span> has the highest
        cumulative housing price, indicating a strong demand for Airbnb accommodations in the state. <span
            class="highlight2">Hawaii</span> and <span class="highlight2">New York</span> have similar cumulative plots,
        suggesting that these three states are the most popular destinations for travelers, considering both demand and
        supply.
        <br>
        Combining the insights from the <span class="highlight">Average Cost of Airbnb Stays in Top Travel States</span>, we
        can conclude that California, Hawaii, and New York have a significant number of housing options available, as their
        average prices are not excessively high, but they have the highest cumulative prices. <span class="highlight3">This indicates that these
        states offer a wide range of accommodations to cater to different budgets and preferences</span>.
        <br>
        The interactive visualization of price and room types by state provides valuable information for travelers, hosts,
        and real estate investors. It allows users to understand the room type trends, popular destinations, and overall

        <p class="description">If your budget is limited, exploring states with lower Airbnb prices can be a smart choice. These states can offer more
        affordable options for accommodation, allowing you to stretch your budget and make the most of your travel experience.
        You'll find it easier to find entire homes/apartments on Airbnb, providing you with more privacy and convenience during
        your stay.
        <br>
        On the other hand, if you're considering Airbnb as an investment opportunity, big cities can be an ideal choice. Major
        cities tend to attract a significant number of travelers, both for business and leisure purposes. This high demand
        creates potential for profitable returns on your investment. By investing in Airbnb properties in these bustling cities,
        you can tap into a steady stream of travelers and maximize your rental income.
        <br>
        Wherever your Airbnb adventures take you, remember to have fun and prioritize your safety. Explore new destinations,
        immerse yourself in different cultures, and create unforgettable memories. As you embark on your journey, take
        precautions, and stay informed about local guidelines and travel advisories. Embrace the joy of travel while keeping
        your well-being in mind. Enjoy the experience, make new connections, and cherish every moment. Happy travels, and may
        your Airbnb stays be filled with excitement, discovery, and treasured experiences.
